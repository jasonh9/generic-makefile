# Generic Makefile
> a simple yet effective generic multi-file makefile to build C applications. Uses default g++/gcc compiler.

## Usage
> This makefile will build all sources within the `src` directory. To print out a help menu execute the command
> `make help` it will give you useless information.

##### Additional notes
> I have included a sample C++ program in the `src` directory, do as you wish, delete it, publish it, burn it.


## Same Directory Build
> I have included a second makefile that allows for same directory source code build, just rename makefile_same_dir
> to makefile.
